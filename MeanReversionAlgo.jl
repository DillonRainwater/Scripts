#The Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process {\displaystyle x_{t}}x_{t} is defined by the following stochastic differential equation:
#{\displaystyle dx_{t}=-\theta \,x_{t}\,dt+\sigma \,dW_{t}}{\displaystyle dx_{t}=-\theta \,x_{t}\,dt+\sigma \,dW_{t}}

#The standard deviation of the most recent prices (e.g., the last 20) is often used as a buy or sell indicator.
